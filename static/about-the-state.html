            Edinburgh of the Seven seas - is the only settlement that is placed at the constituent part of the
            British
            Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            The territory consists of the inhabited island Tristan da Cunha, which has a diameter of roughly 11
            kilometers and an
            area of 98 square kilometers.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            As of October 2018, the main island had 250 permanent inhabitants, who all hold British Overseas
            Territories
            citizenship.

          <h1>Political system</h1>
          <h3>
            There are no political parties or trade unions on Tristan. Executive authority is vested in the King,
            who is represented in the territory by the governor of Tristan da Cunha.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Tristan da Cunha was a dependency of Saint Helena, and therefore directly represented by the governor of
            Saint Helena up until 2009.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            The Island Council is made up of eight elected and three appointed members, who serve a three-year term
            beginning in February or March.

          <h1>Flora and Fauna</h1>
          <h3>
            Many of the flora and fauna of the archipelago have a broad circumpolar distribution in the South Atlantic
            and South Pacific Oceans.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Tristan is primarily known for its wildlife. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by
            BirdLife International because there are 13 known species of breeding seabirds on the island and two
            species of resident land birds.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Various species of whales and dolphins can be seen around Tristan from time to time with increasing
            sighting rates, although recovery of baleen whales, especially the southern right whale, were severely
            hindered by illegal whaling by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the 1960 volcanic eruption.
